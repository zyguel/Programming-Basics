# this makefile illustrates a custom pattern which takes the
# last 10 lines of a file

# the default target has a single pre-requisite which is the file
# we want to build
default: x.txt.end

# this is the custom pattern that matches x.txt.end
# it looks for a file x.txt and if it exists, executes the rule
# the rule uses the automatic variables $^ and $@ to reference
# the pre-requisites and target name respectively
%.txt.end: %.txt
	cat $^ | tail -n 10 > $@
